<pre><code class="language-python">array = bytes([31, 32, 126, 127])
print(array)</code></pre>
<p>Its output is as follows: <code class="language-python">b'\x1f ~\x7f'</code>.</p>
<p>Basing on this info, what would be the output of the following expression?</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(bytes([126]))</code></pre>
<p>Put your answer in the text box.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b>  Remember that numbers from 32 to 126 (inclusively) are usually printed as single characters, while other numbers are represented as a backslash with <code class="language-python">x</code> and two more characters. And don't forget to include the <code class="language-python">b</code> and the quotes in your answer! </p>
