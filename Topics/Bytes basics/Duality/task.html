<p>We have converted a string <code class="language-python">'corgi'</code> to bytes. Look at the following lines of code and pick a correct statement to describe the output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">never_bites = b'corgi'

# 1
print(never_bites)

# 2
print(never_bites[0] + never_bites[1] + never_bites[2] + never_bites[3] + never_bites[4])
</code></pre>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Bytes objects may not be what they seem: though symbols can be represented as a string with <strong>b</strong> prefix, they are converted to corresponding code points. Code points, in turn, are just numbers, so it's possible to add them up.</div>
